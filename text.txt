in server folder:

- need to use npm init -y to use npm libraries to create backend

- npm init -y
- npm i body-parser cors express mongoose nodemon

- change server/package.json to include "start": "nodemon index.js" and "type": "module" to indicate where the server should run and to be able to import express instead of declaring a const

body-parser:

- enables us to send POST requests

cors: 

- enables cross origin requests

express:

- used as a framework for creating the routing of application

mongoose:

- create models for our posts

nodemon:

- don't have to reset server after changes
